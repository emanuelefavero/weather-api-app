# Weather API React App

This is a simple React app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather in a city.

> Note: This app uses vite, react, typescript, and sass

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo, and `cd` into it
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key to it like so:

```text
VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

- Install the dependencies and run the dev server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser
